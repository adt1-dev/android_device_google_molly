# Google ADT-1 ("molly") Device Configuration 

This branch intends to restore full tablet-like functionallity to the ADT-1 (molly).

This needs to be used in place of the default "molly" device tree in a PureNexus tree.

This is dependent upon the 'mm-tablet' branch of both 'android_vendor_google' & 'proprietary_vendor_nexus'.
